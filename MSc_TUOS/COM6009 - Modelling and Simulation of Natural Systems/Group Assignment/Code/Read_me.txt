----------------------Introduction of the files-------------------------------
Our code has 3 matlab files.
The main has all the input information and it is a xlm files.
The function plot_cows plots the locations of healthy cows and disease cows.
The function ger_iter defines how the cows moves in one hour and how the disease spread and when they will eat and sleep.


----------------------How to use the main matlab code-------------------------------
If you want to change the input for a larger farm or larger population you just need to change it in Part 1

if you want to change the size of the drinking area you can change it in the plot cow areas.

If you run part 3 code you will get the figure: intial location

if you run part 4 code you will get the figure: Location of cows in days

if you run part 5 code you will get the figure: Change of infected rate of days when quarantine at different time

if you run part 6 code you will get the figure: Final infection rate


----------------------One thing to remind-------------------------------
Our code use the function binornd(1,p) which means you have to install the statistics and machine learning tool boxes
