# SelfOrganisingMaps

A collection of tools for constructing mechanistic models of cortical map self-organization.

The code has been developed around an implementation of GCAL model reported in Stevens et al., (2013) J. Neurosci. paper. (https://www.jneurosci.org/content/33/40/15747)

A demonstration is implemented in the folder models/examples, where you will find a README.md document with full instructions for running the code.
